# at15

I mainly work on observability related services and clients like
[AWS X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html) and [CloudWatch Application Signals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Monitoring-Sections.html). I was a maintainer of [CloudWatch Agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent) and [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector). I used to work on k8s at PayPal and Google before moving to Canada (Yeah, H1-B visa LoL).

I don't have any actively maintained public repositories right now. I plan to revive my Go and database projects and open source some websites I built using Next.js and Cloudflare, once I clean up all the copilot-generated code... (wait, I wrote cursor generatd code and cursor changed it to copilot when I told it to fix grammar error...)

Outside work, I play tennis at Burnaby and Richmond tennis clubs. You can find a list of courts in BC at [search.tennis](https://search.tennis/court/ca/bc).
If you want to play, you can drop me a message on LinkedIn.

## About the name at15

[AT15](https://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Tank:GB72_AT15) is a British tank destroyer in World of Tanks, and Badger is the only tier 10 tank I ever got.
I used to think I would never get tired of gaming, but I was wrong.
