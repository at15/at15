# at15

I am currently working on @wandb Artifacts.
Previously, I worked on observability at [AWS X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html).
I was a maintainer of [CloudWatch Agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent) and [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector).
I used to work on Kubernetes at PayPal and Google before moving to Canada (thanks to H1-B).
Back in school, I worked on [time series database](https://github.com/xephonhq/awesome-time-series-database).

I don't have any actively maintained public repositories right now.
I plan to revive my Go and database projects and open source some websites I built.

Outside of work, I play tennis at Burnaby and Richmond tennis clubs.
You can find a list of courts in BC at [search.tennis](https://search.tennis/court/ca/bc).
If you want to play, feel free to message me on LinkedIn.
